The LPJ-GUESS model can be coupled to R with the RLPJ package available here https://github.com/biometry/RLPJ The package does not include the model source code. If you are interested to work with LPJ-GUESS, you need get into contact with the LPJ-GUESS developers. Thomas Hickler (member of PROFOUND) can provide information about details. For questions about the R package, get in touch with [Florian Hartig](http://www.uni-regensburg.de/biologie-vorklinische-medizin/theoretische-oekologie/index.html)
