LPJ-GUESS
===

There are 3 LPJ-GUESS packages whose development profited from PROFOUND activities

* For calibration, the LPJ-GUESS model can be coupled to R with the RLPJ package available here https://github.com/biometry/RLPJ 
* To created output modules for LPJ-GUESS, use https://github.com/joergsteinkamp/newOutputModule4LPJGUESS
* For visualization of the outputs, use https://github.com/joergsteinkamp/RLPJGUESS 

The package does not include the model source code. If you are interested to work with LPJ-GUESS, you need get into contact with the LPJ-GUESS developers. Thomas Hickler (member of PROFOUND) can provide information about details. For questions about the R package, get in touch with [Florian Hartig](http://www.uni-regensburg.de/biologie-vorklinische-medizin/theoretische-oekologie/index.html)
