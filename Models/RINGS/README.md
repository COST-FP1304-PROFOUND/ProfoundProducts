# RINGS

RINGS is a FORTRAN-based model that mechanistically treats wood formation of an individual tree.

The model is still under development and the source code and package are therefore not
available yet.
Further model and package development will be supported by knowledge gained during various PROFOUND activities.


Initial developments were made by [Andrew Friend](https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/friend/).
Further developments are made by Annemarie Eckes.  If you have any questions, please contact
