# PROFOUND Products

This repository is divided into 3 sections 

1. Data - PROFOUND R package for data access, as well as scripts used for processing the raw data
2. Models - R packages for models used within PROFOUND. Many of the models have profited from collaborations / STSMs within PROFOUND
3. Software and Protocols - Statistical algorithms and analysis protocols developed by PRODOUND


Navigate to the subfolders and follow the instructions there to run code / install packages 

Many of the packages are developed outside this repository, meaning that we either provide a copy or fork, or a direct link to the package. You should always contact the developer to check if there is a newer version of the model that is not yet made available here.
