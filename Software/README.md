# Statistical software / algorithms for model calibration and uncertainty analysis

Collaboration between researchers from PROFOUND has facilitated the development of the BayesianTools package, available at on CRAN ([here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesianTools/index.html)).

The package contains several general-purpose MCMC and SMC samplers, as well as plot and diagnostic functions for Bayesian statistics, with a particular focus on calibrating complex system models. Implemented samplers include various Metropolis MCMC variants (including adaptive and/or delayed rejection MH), the T-walk, two differential evolution MCMCs, two DREAM MCMCs, and a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) particle filter. A user manual (vignette) is available on CRAN [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesianTools/vignettes/BayesianTools.html)

Additionally to the vignette, there is also a more extended manual / protocol for model calibration with forrest models (WG3 tutorial, see section protocls), that however, is currently only available on request.
