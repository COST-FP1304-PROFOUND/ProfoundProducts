# Statistical algorithms for model calibration

PROFOUND has facilitated the development of the BayesianTools package, available at on CRAN ([here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesianTools/index.html)). 

The package contains several general-purpose MCMC and SMC samplers, as well as plot and diagnostic functions for Bayesian statistics, with a particular focus on calibrating complex system models. Implemented samplers include various Metropolis MCMC variants (including adaptive and/or delayed rejection MH), the T-walk, two differential evolution MCMCs, two DREAM MCMCs, and a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) particle filter. A user manual (vignette) is available on CRAN [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesianTools/vignettes/BayesianTools.html)

There is an extend manual for model calibration with (WG3 tutorial, see below) that, however, is currently only available on request. 


# Protocols


Currently, there are 2 main protocols developed by PROFOUND

* the ISI-MIP protocol for standardized model comparisons (contact Christoph Reyer)

* The WG3 model calibration tutorial / protocol (contact Florian Hartig), which also acts as an extended tutorial to the BayesianTools package

Both protocols are available on request
